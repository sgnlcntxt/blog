This week, I took a JavaScript Bootcamp course on Scrimba.

In this post, I will discuss three topics which I learned about JavaScript:
  1. Arrow Functions
  2. The reduce function for arrays
  
First, Arrow functions are a way to make our code shorter and more readable (in some cases). You can reduce the following function:

function divideThree(nums) {  return nums / 3}function timesThree(nums) {
  return nums * 2
}

to this:

var divideThree = nums => nums / 3

This is a very new syntax for me and will take some getting used to.

Second, the reduce function is essentially a shorthand for a for loop that you can use on an Array. You can use reduce to filter arrays, sum arrays, and a number of other use cases.

A reduce function looks something like this:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
let sum = numbers.reduce(function (acc, number) {
    return acc + number;
});
